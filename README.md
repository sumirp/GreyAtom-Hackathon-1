SafeTravel Inc. is one of the world's largest insurance companies specializing in travel insurance. During travel, there are a lot of risk factors - loss of baggage, airline cancellations, health issues etc. The potential customers are travellers who want to insure themselves against travel-related risks. They have different product offerings like 1-way travel insurance, 2-way insurance, insurance against cancellations and so on. They receive thousands of claims spread across different products.

Wrongly denying a genuine claim could lead to lawsuits against the company and approving the wrong claim would lead to a loss.   Automatically predicting the claims could lead to a lot of benefits and solve some other supplementary problems too.
